# Customer-churn-prediction

Abstract 
Customer churn prediction for a telecom company. Customers who left within the last month is called Churn. For each customer, there is information about how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges, and others. Given that information, this project aims to answer if it is possibile to predict whether a customer will stop doing business with the company. To answer it, an artificial neural network was utilized with 80% accuracy on the respective test data. So yes, it is possible to predict customer churn from the given data.

Data and Methods
Data: This project uses data from Telco Customer Churn downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn. The data set includes information about: Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Methods: 
Correlation matrix, heatmap, univariate selection, deep learning (tensorflow), histogram, confusion matrix, stratified hold out split

Results: 
An artificial neural network was utilized with 80% accuracy on the respective test data. So yes, it is possible to predict customer churn from the given data.
